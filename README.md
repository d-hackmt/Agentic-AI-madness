## 📌 What Is *Agentic AI*?

Agentic AI refers to systems that go beyond just answering questions — they **reason, plan, take actions, use tools, and solve multi-step tasks autonomously**. 
They’re like giving your app a tiny AI worker that can make decisions on its own.

**What it is:**  
LangChain is a widely used open-source framework to build applications around large language models (LLMs). 
It supports things like chatbots, retrieval workflows, summarization, and connecting models to external tools. 

**Why use it:**  
- Great ecosystem for integrating models with tools and databases  
- Flexible building blocks for complex tasks

**Unique point:**  
Massive integrations and community support.

**🤪 Joke:**  
LangChain is like **AI LEGO** — you snap pieces together and hope it builds what you imagined! 😆

**What it is:**  
LangGraph is an extension of LangChain designed for building **stateful agent workflows** using graph logic (nodes + edges), ideal for multi-step reasoning and long processes. 

**Why use it:**  
- Better at structured, multi-step workflows  
- Works tightly with the LangChain ecosystem

**Unique point:**  
Graph-based orchestration — think *workflow maps* for AI.
